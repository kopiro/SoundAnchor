Crystal-clear audio, seamless switching—effortlessly.

A lightweight app that lives in your Mac’s toolbar that gives you full control over microphone priorities, letting you set your preferred mic to automatically take over whenever it’s available.

This is particularly useful if you use AirPods; when connected to a Mac, AirPods automatically switch the system microphone to their built-in mic during calls or recordings. This reduces audio quality to 16kHz (instead of 48KHz) because Bluetooth bandwidth is split between the microphone and the speaker.

Even MacBook’s microphone is way superior to the AirPods’ built-in mic; yet, there’s no native way to stop your AirPods from defaulting to their internal mic.
